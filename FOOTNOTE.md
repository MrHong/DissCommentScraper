It must be noted that on Biznes Online website, responses are displayed in a tree-like form only up to the fourth comment in an exchange. To allow a meaningfull evaluation of all the comments it was necessary to get them in their original structure and ordered by the time of their creation. This was archived by running a so called userscript on the websites documentstructure which extracted every comment, its data (username, creationdate, and text), and the relation to other comments. After extraction the comments were sorted by time, keeping its relation to parent and child comments. The source code for the userscript can be found at [https://github.com/MrHong/DissCommentScraper](https://github.com/MrHong/DissCommentScraper)
