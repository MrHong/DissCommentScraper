Scraping and sorting (by time) comments from a website.

## Funtionality
This Script reads the whole commenttree of a business-gazeta.ru/article site and sorts the whole tree including every subcomment by the 'data-public-time' attribute. 
From the sorted tree it creates a downloadable file with all the comments and data for further editing.

### Prerequisites
Software used:
  - Chrome 74.0.3729 [Website](https://www.google.com/chrome/)
  - Tampermonkey 4.8 [Website](https://www.tampermonkey.net/)

The whole Setup should also work with Firefox as Browser and Greasemonkey as Userscript Manager.
